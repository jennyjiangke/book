# Social Network Analysis 

## Introduction

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a method of analyzing social structures by examining the relationships between social actors, such as individuals, organizations, or countries. In SNA, actors are represented as **nodes** or **vertices**, and relationships between them are represented as **links** or **edges**. The type of relationship can be **undirected** (e.g., friendship) or directed (e.g., **communication flow**), and it can also be **weighted** (e.g., strength of ties).

Here's an example R code to create a simple network graph:

```{r}
library(igraph)

# Create a sample graph with 4 nodes and 3 edges
g <- graph(edges=c(1,2,2,3,3,4), n=4, directed=FALSE)

# Plot the graph
plot(g, layout=layout.circle, vertex.label=1:4)
```
The graph() function from the igraph package is used to create the graph. The edges argument is used to specify the edges of the graph by passing a vector of node pairs. In this case, the graph is specified by passing the vector c(1,2,2,3,3,4), which means that there are three edges: (1,2), (2,3), and (3,4). The n argument is used to specify the number of nodes in the graph.

After creating the graph object g, the plot() function is used to visualize it. The layout.circle argument specifies that the graph should be displayed in a circular layout. The vertex.label argument specifies the labels for each node, in this case simply 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) involves several steps that researchers follow to understand the relationships and flows between social actors. The steps include:

**Designing the study**: The researcher selects appropriate research questions that will guide the study. For example, imagine you're a social butterfly who loves attending parties and making new friends. You're always curious about how people communicate and build relationships within a social circle. To explore this further, you decide to conduct a study on the patterns of communication within a social network. You want to understand how people interact, what topics they discuss, and how information spreads through the network.

**Identifying relevant data sources**: The researcher identifies data sources that will provide the necessary information to answer the research questions. For example, social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn can provide valuable data for a social network analysis.

**Collecting data**: Once the data sources are identified, the researcher collects the relevant data. Data can be collected through surveys, interviews, web scraping, or APIs.

**Analyzing data**: After collecting the data, the researcher analyzes it to identify patterns and structures in the network. There are several techniques and methods available for analyzing social network data, such as centrality measures, community detection, and network visualization.

**Reviewing data**: The researcher reviews the data to ensure that it is accurate and complete. This step involves checking for missing data, outliers, and errors.

**Preparing evaluation**: Once the data is reviewed, the researcher prepares an evaluation of the results. This step involves summarizing the findings and drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

**Moving into action**: Finally, the researcher moves into action by using the insights gained from the analysis to inform decision-making, policy development, or interventions. For example, a company may use the findings from a social network analysis to identify key influencers in their target market and develop targeted marketing campaigns.

## Centrality Measures

Centrality measures are important metrics in SNA that help to identify the most important nodes or actors in the network. **Degree centrality** measures the number of links that a node has to other nodes. **Closeness centrality** measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. **Betweenness centrality** measures the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes. **Eigenvector centrality** measures a node's importance based on the importance of its neighbors.

Here's an example R code to compute the centrality measures for a sample network graph:

```{r}

# Let's create a sample graph with 5 nodes and 6 edges
g <- graph(edges=c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5,4,5), n=5, directed=FALSE)

# Compute degree centrality
degree_centrality <- degree(g)

# Compute closeness centrality
closeness_centrality <- closeness(g)

# Compute betweenness centrality
betweenness_centrality <- betweenness(g)

# Compute eigenvector centrality
eigenvector_centrality <- eigen_centrality(g)$vector

# Plot the graph
plot(g, layout=layout.circle, vertex.label=1:5)

# Print the centrality measures for each node
for (i in 1:vcount(g)) {
  cat(paste("Node", i, ": Degree=", degree_centrality[i], 
            "Closeness=", closeness_centrality[i],
            "Betweenness=", betweenness_centrality[i], 
            "Eigenvector=", eigenvector_centrality[i], "\n"))
}

```

In this example, we create a sample network graph with 5 nodes and 6 edges. We then compute the four centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector) for each node using the appropriate functions provided by the igraph package. Finally, we print out the centrality measures for each node.

The code above is using a for loop to iterate over each node in the graph, with the variable "i" representing the node index. Within the loop, the "cat" function is used to print a message that includes the centrality measures for that particular node. The "paste" function is used to concatenate the various pieces of information into a single string.

Note that the output will show the centrality measures for each node in the network. You can use these measures to identify the most important nodes or actors in the network based on the particular centrality measure of interest.

When the "cat" function is used to print a message, including the "\n" sequence in the message string will cause the output to be separated into multiple lines, with each new line starting after the "\n" character.

So in the code provided, including the "\n" sequence at the end of the message string ensures that each line of output corresponds to a single node in the graph, making it easier to read and interpret the output.

## Density, Reciprocity & Moduarity

Other important network metrics include **density**, which measures the proportion of possible connections that are present in the network, and **reciprocity**, which measures the extent to which relationships are mutual. **Modularity** measures the extent to which a network is divided into subgroups or modules.

Here are some R code examples to compute these network metrics:

```{r}
# Let's create a sample graph with 6 nodes and 8 edges
g <- graph(edges=c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,4,3,5,4,5,5,6), n=6, directed=FALSE)

# Compute density
density <- graph.density(g)

# Print the density
cat(paste("The density of the network is", density, "\n"))
```

In this example, we create a sample network graph with 6 nodes and 8 edges. We then compute the density of the graph using the graph.density function provided by the igraph package. The output shows the density of the network. We can tell that approximately 53.33% of all possible edges are present in the above network.

A high network density can indicate a highly interconnected network, while a low density can indicate a more sparse or disconnected network. The specific interpretation of a density value depends on the context of the network being analyzed and the goals of the analysis.

```{r}
# Let's create another sample graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges
g <- graph(edges=c(1,2,1,3,2,3,3,4,4,3,4,5,5,4), n=5, directed=TRUE)

# Compute reciprocity
reciprocity <- reciprocity(g)

# Print the reciprocity
cat(paste("The reciprocity of the network is", reciprocity, "\n"))

```
In the above example, we create a sample directed network graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges. We then compute the reciprocity of the graph using the reciprocity function provided by the igraph package. The output shows the reciprocity of the network is .57, indicating that each pair of nodes in the network that are connected by a directed edge, approximately 57.14% of those pairs have reciprocal edges (i.e., edges going in both directions).

Reciprocity is an important measure of the symmetry of relationships in a network. A high reciprocity value indicates a high level of mutual connection or interaction between nodes, while a low reciprocity value indicates a more one-sided or unbalanced set of relationships.

The interpretation of a reciprocity value also depends on the context of the network being analyzed and the specific research question or hypothesis being tested.

```{r}

# Let's create a more dense graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges
g <- graph(edges=c(1,2,1,3,1,4,2,3,2,5,3,5,4,5,6,7,6,8,6,9,6,10,8,9,9,10), n=10, directed=FALSE)

# Compute modularity
modularity <- modularity(g, membership=clusters(g)$membership)

# Print the modularity
cat(paste("The modularity of the network is", modularity, "\n"))

```

In this example, we create a sample network graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges. We then compute the modularity of the graph using the modularity function provided by the igraph package. The membership argument is used to specify the clusters or modules in the network. The output shows modularity of the network is .49, indicating This means that the network has a relatively high degree of modularity, indicating that the above network can be partitioned into relatively distinct and densely connected groups of nodes.

But the specific interpretation of a modularity value depends on the context of the network being analyzed and the research question or hypothesis being tested. It is also worth noting that different methods of calculating modularity may yield slightly different values, and modularity values can be affected by factors such as network size, density, and edge weight.

In summary, SNA is a powerful method for analyzing social structures and relationships. By examining patterns of connections and interactions between social actors, SNA can help to identify key actors and structures in a network, and can inform interventions and policy decisions aimed at improving social outcomes.

## A Case Study of Social Networks from Twitter Conversations

This case study focuses on analyzing social networks from Twitter conversations. Three different types of networks were identified and analyzed: **Mention Network**, **Message Network**, **User-Sources Network**. 

### Mention Network

A mention network is a way to understand how Twitter users interact with each other. Each Twitter user is represented as a point in the network. When one user mentions another user in a tweet, a line is drawn from the mentioning user to the mentioned user. This line represents the interaction between the two users. The more often a user mentions another user, the stronger the line will be between them. The mention network can help researchers analyze patterns of communication on Twitter, identify important users or "hubs" in the network, find groups of users who tend to interact with each other frequently or "communities," and categorize user accounts based on their interactions with others.

Here's an example R code that uses the rtweet package to collect the most recent tweets containing the #ChatGPT hashtag, creates a mention network, performs some basic network analysis, and visualizes the network using the igraph package:

```{r}
library(rtweet)
library(igraph)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# search for tweets containing #ChatGPT and retrieve up to 1000 tweets
tweets <- search_tweets("#ChatGPT", n = 1000)

# extract mentions_screen_name column and drop NAs
mentions <- tweets %>% 
  select(screen_name, mentions_screen_name) %>% 
  filter(!mentions_screen_name == "NA")

# separate multiple mentions_screen_name into separate rows
mentions <- mentions %>% 
  separate_rows(mentions_screen_name, sep = ",") %>% 
  filter(!mentions_screen_name == "")

# create mention network data frame
mentions_net <- mentions %>% 
  group_by(screen_name, mentions_screen_name) %>% 
  summarize(weight = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

# rename columns to source and target
colnames(mentions_net)[1:2] <- c("source", "target")

#export the mention network
write.csv(mentions_net, "~/Jenny/teaching/329/chatgpt_mention.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# create directed graph
mentions_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(mentions_net, directed = TRUE)

#shows the number of nodes
vcount(mentions_graph)
#shows the number of edges
ecount(mentions_graph)
#let's count average link weight
ecount(mentions_graph)/vcount(mentions_graph)
#show density
edge_density(mentions_graph, loops = FALSE)

#Centrality
options(scipen = 999) # turn off scientific notation for all variables
options(digits = 4) # define the digits 

# calculate centrality measures
indegree <- data.frame(name = V(mentions_graph)$name, indegree = degree(mentions_graph, mode = "in"))
outdegree <- data.frame(name = V(mentions_graph)$name, outdegree = degree(mentions_graph, mode = "out"))
closeness <- data.frame(name = V(mentions_graph)$name, closeness = closeness(mentions_graph, mode = "total"))
betweenness <- data.frame(name = V(mentions_graph)$name, betweenness = betweenness(mentions_graph, directed = TRUE, normalized = TRUE))
eigenvector <- data.frame(name = V(mentions_graph)$name, eigenvector = eigen_centrality(mentions_graph, directed = FALSE)$vector)

# combine into a single dataframe
centrality_df <- merge(indegree, outdegree, by = "name", all = TRUE)
centrality_df <- merge(centrality_df, closeness, by = "name", all = TRUE)
centrality_df <- merge(centrality_df, betweenness, by = "name", all = TRUE)
centrality_df <- merge(centrality_df, eigenvector, by = "name", all = TRUE)

```
We've got a whopping 750 nodes in this mention network. For better-looking and more informative visualizations of large-scale networks, it's a good idea to use fancy network analysis and visualization tools like Gephi. You can grab a copy of Gephi here: https://gephi.org/users/download/

Gephi is a free and open-source network visualization and analysis tool that allows you to create complex and aesthetically pleasing network visualizations. It provides a user-friendly interface and a variety of tools for network analysis, including measures of centrality, clustering, and community detection.

For larger networks, Gephi can be more efficient and powerful than using R packages such as igraph and ggplot2. However, it does require some learning curve and familiarity with network analysis concepts.

This is the optimized network visualization generated by Gephi:

Well, look at this mention visualization! It seems like the recent ChatGPT conversations have sparked a whole bunch of mini conversation clusters. And it looks like @CerfiaFR, a French research center that's all about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive science, performs as a hub of a big group of chatty folks talking about #ChatGPT.

### Message Network

A Twitter message network is a way to analyze how Twitter users communicate with each other using replies. Each Twitter user is represented as a point in the network. When one user sends a message to another user in reply to their tweet, a line is drawn from the sender to the receiver. This line represents the interaction between the two users. The more often a user sends a message to another user, the stronger the line will be between them. The message network can help researchers analyze patterns of communication on Twitter, identify important users or "hubs" in the network, find groups of users who tend to interact with each other frequently or "communities," and categorize user accounts based on their interactions with others. It is called a directed network because the lines have an arrow that points from the sender to the receiver, indicating the direction of the interaction.

### User-Source Network

A user-source Twitter network is a type of undirected network that involves two types of nodes - users and sources. The links between these nodes are created based on the co-occurrence of users and the source of their tweets. For example, if a user sends a tweet from a particular source (e.g. Twitter Web App, Hootsuite, Tweetdeck), a link is created between the user and the source. The more often they appear together, the stronger the link between them.

This type of network can be used to explore the relationships between users and the sources they use to tweet. By analyzing the network, we can find and analyze which users use which clients (or sources). This information can be useful for understanding how users interact with different sources and for categorizing user accounts.

## A Case Study of Social-Semantic Networks of Twitter Conversations

A social-semantic network is a type of network that combines both social and semantic elements. In social networks, the focus is on the relationships between individuals, whereas in semantic networks, the focus is on the meaning or topics of the information being exchanged. Social-semantic networks, therefore, are networks that capture both the social relationships between individuals and the topics or themes of the conversations they have.

The case study examines two types of networks, namely the Hashtag-User Network and the Hashtag-Mention network. In these networks, hashtags represent the semantics of the conversations, while user and mention represent the social aspect. The study aims to identify the prominent semantic topics in conversations among different user groups.

### Hashtag-User Network

A Hashtag-User network is a type of network where hashtags and Twitter users are the nodes, and the links between them represent the co-occurrence of a user and a hashtag in a tweet. For example, if a user wrote a tweet with a certain hashtag, there will be a link between that user and the hashtag in the hashtag-user network. The strength of the link is based on how often the user and the hashtag appear together in tweets.

This type of network can be used to explore the relationship between users and hashtags, find out which users are interested in which topics, and analyze the patterns of communication among different user groups on Twitter.

### Hashtag-Mention Network

A Hashtag-Mention network is a type of undirected network that involves two types of nodes: hashtags and @mentions. In this network, a link is created between a hashtag and an @mention if they co-occur in a tweet. The link weight is determined by the frequency of co-occurrence, meaning that the more often a hashtag and an @mention appear together, the stronger the link between them.

The primary use of a hashtag-mention network is to explore the relational activity between mentioned users and hashtags, which allows for the identification of users who are considered experts around particular topics. By analyzing this network, one can understand which hashtags are frequently mentioned together and which users tend to be mentioned together with certain hashtags.
