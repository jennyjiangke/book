In particular, the ability to use statistics to analyze and interpret the data obtained from tracking user interactions on websites and social media platforms make Communications students stand out in competitive job markets from a variety of industries. However, the integration of analytics into universities’ communication programs and curricula (e.g., Journalism, Television and Cinema, Public Relations, Strategic Communications, Communication Design, Health Communication, Sports Communication, Environmental Communication) is yet to catch up to the industry’s new demands. To address this need, this book introduces Communication students to R, which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, to measure and analyze audiences’ digital footprints, employ data-driven problem solving to gauge audience engagement, formulate insights, plan and execute strategies, and evaluate outcomes.

Any quality that can vary can be considered a variable. Variables can take on different values or attributes. An attribute is a specific value on a variable. For example, gender might be a variable that we are interested in, and the attributes of gender could be male, female, transgender, and non-binary. We use levels of measurement to describe how precisely variables are recorded. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio representing the transition from analyzing qualitative to quantitative data. 2.1.1 Nominal Data Nominal data is used to label variables. Gender, nationality, race, and ethnicity are a few of the most common examples of nominal data. It can only be categorized based on qualitative differences and there are no orderings or directions among different categories. We only know that males and females have qualitative differences in terms of gender, but we cannot tell how much they differ, nor could we sort individuals based on their gender. We can still assign numbers to different attributes of nominal variables (e.g., we can assign 1 to females and 2 to males, or vice versa), but the numbers only serve as labels that lack numerical values. For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 1), the variable Channel is measured at the nominal level, and it indicates the channel through which traffic got to Google Merchandise Store. Organic Search indicates visits from unpaid search results. Direct indicates visits where users navigated directly to the URL, or the source of the visit is unknown. Referral indicates traffic where users clicked a link from another site, excluding major search engines. Display indicates traffic from display advertising, such as Google AdWords remarketing campaigns. Social indicates visits from social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Paid Search indicates traffic from the PPC (Pay Per Click) campaigns run in search results. Since each variable should be exhaustive to include all the possibilities, for the variable of Channel, the attribute “Other” is assigned referring to traffic from an un-identified channel. All these different channels through which a user reaches our website are different attributes our channel variable can have. 2.1.2 Ordinal Data Ordinal data also can be categorized, but there are rankings or orderings or scaling between categories. The ordinal measurement has been widely used to analyze variables such as education level (e.g., “high school,” “BS,” “MS,” “Ph.D.”), income level (e.g., “less than 50K,” “50-100K,” “over 100K”), and socioeconomic status (e.g., “lower class,” “middle class,” and “upper class”). For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 2.1), the variable Age is also ordinal, and it refers to the age group of the users. For such ordinal variable, we can turn it into quantitative by assigning numerical values to different categories. For example, Age can be defined as having six attributes:1 = 18-24; 2 = 25-34; 3 = 35-44; 4 = 45-54; 5 = 55-64; 6 = 65+. There is a logical ordering among the different age groups, in a way that whoever answers “6” is older than individuals who answer “5” to this question. However, we cannot precisely tell the differences between the two groups because each attribute covers a wide range, and the ranges of different attributes are of different sizes. 2.1.3 Interval Data Interval data refers not only to the classification and ordering of data but also specifies that the distances between every two adjacent attributes on a scale are equal. For interval data, the difference between two values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point or fixed beginning, which refers to a scale where 0 indicates the absence of something. The most popular example is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. The difference between 90 degrees F and 80 degrees F is the same difference between 70 degrees F and 60 degrees F; however, when it comes to 0 degrees F, we cannot say that temperature no longer exists. For interval measures, the value 0 does not mean the absence of this variable; rather, it is just an arbitrary setting that we have agreed upon. Another example of interval data is year. For year, 0 does not represent the missing value but indicates the year when Christ was born, and the time before 0 is given the prefix BC. If you were born in the year of 2005 and I was born in the year of 2000, we know that I will be five years older than you. For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 2.1), the only interval variable is Year, indicating the year of each observation. 2.1.4 Ratio Data For ratio data, the difference between two values is also meaningful, and it has a true zero, indicating the absence of such variable. Media consumption is a great example of ratio data. Media consumption can be measured in days, hours, or minutes a person exposes him/herself to media content. If a person has zero media consumption, that means this person does not consume media at all; in other words, to this person, media consumption is absent. For ratio data, zero is the starting point, and the distance between two adjacent values is the same. In addition, it makes sense to calculate the ratio of different values: If you have six hours of media consumption and I only have three hours, then we can say that you consume twice as much media as I do. Table 2.1 has six ratio variables. Sessions are the total number of sessions within the date range. A session is the period time a user is actively engaged with the website of Google Merchandise Store. Users are the number of users who have initiated at least one session during the date range, with the value of zero representing no such user exists. New Users are the number of first-time users during the selected date range. Transactions are the number of completed purchases on Google Merchandise Store. Ecommerce Conversion Rate refers to the E-commerce conversion rate that is the percentage of sessions that resulted in an e-commerce transaction. Revenue refers to the revenue of the completed purchases. If the revenue from the display channel is 0, that just means there is no income produced by the display Ads. What you can do to analyze your data may be limited due to the level of measurement of the variable. The complexity and precision of the level of measurement increase from nominal to ratio. For the ratio level of measurement, we can not only add numbers or subtract numbers but calculate the ratio of two numbers. For example, if the revenue from the organic search channel is 8k and from the paid search is 4k, then the revenue generated from organic search is twice as much as the revenue from paid search. The rows in a spreadsheet are closely associated with the unit of analysis, which is one of the most important ideas in a research project and the major entity that you are analyzing in your study. You will need to determine the unit of analysis since it determines the analysis you do for your research. For instance, if you are comparing the e-commerce performances (e.g., User, Sessions, Transactions, Revenues, ECR) of different channels, the unit of analysis is each individual channel. If you are comparing the e-commerce performance of different age groups, the unit of analysis is each age group. If you are comparing the e-commerce performance of different channels and age groups, the unit of analysis is each individual channel at each age group. 2.2 Statistical Analyses of a Single Variable After defining your research questions and the related unit(s) of analysis, and levels of measurement, we may start the data analysis journey by conducting a statistical analysis of a single variable. 2.2.1 Frequency Distribution The easiest thing we can do is to count the number of times an event or a value occurs for the variable(s) of our choice, and this is called Frequency analysis. We can aggregate individual observations of a variable into groups so that a frequency distribution of these groups can serve as a convenient means of summarizing or describing our data. We are going to use the dplyr package to count the aggregated transactions by channel and age groups. #Frequency and grouped frequency analysis #You will need to install dplyr package library(dplyr) Transaction_Frequency_Channel &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Frequency = sum(Transactions)) Transaction_Frequency_Age &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Age) %&gt;% summarise(Frequency = sum(Transactions)) Table 2.2 demonstrated the grouped frequency of transactions for each channel and age group. From the frequency analysis, we can tell that the direct channel (n = 11581) and the age group of 25 to 34 (n = 4654) had the greatest number of transactions in Google Merchandise Store. knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Transaction_Frequency_Channel, desc(Frequency))), head(arrange(Transaction_Frequency_Age, desc(Frequency)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Transaction Frequency for Channel and Age&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 2.2: Grouped Transaction Frequency for Channel and Age Channel Frequency Direct 11581 Paid Search 330 (Other) 138 Organic Search 98 Referral 32 Display 6 Age Frequency 25-34 4654 18-24 2558 35-44 2496 45-54 1394 55-64 673 65+ 414 2.2.2 Percentage Change Here, we can also use the grouped frequency analysis to compare the revenue from each channel between 2020 and 2021 to assess the dynamic changes of each channel. #Creat a subset for year 2020 and year 2021 my_data_2020 &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(Year == 2020) my_data_2021 &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(Year == 2021) Revenue_Frequency_2020 &lt;- my_data_2020 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Revenue = sum(Revenue)) Revenue_Frequency_2021 &lt;- my_data_2021 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Revenue = sum(Revenue)) As illustrated in Table 2.3, the direct channel created the most revenues in both 2020 and 2021. When you have such data for two points in time, you can calculate how much change there has been over this period. The result is expressed as a percentage in absolute numbers and is called the percentage change or the rate of change. Here is the formula: Percentage Change = [(Number at later time / Number at earlier time) - 1] × 100%. knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Revenue_Frequency_2020, desc(Revenue))), head(arrange(Revenue_Frequency_2021, desc(Revenue)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 2.3: Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021 Channel Revenue Direct 23565.6812 Organic Search 4628.4410 (Other) 3154.8063 Paid Search 1975.9309 Referral 864.7263 Social 164.8144 Channel Revenue Direct 921363.0041 Paid Search 29908.1791 (Other) 5193.1180 Referral 852.0686 Display 354.3391 Organic Search 188.6451 For example, from Table 2.3, in 2020, the revenue generated from the paid search channel was $1975.93. And in 2020, the revenue generated from the paid search channel was 29908.18. The percentage change of revenue from the paid search channel from 2020 to 2021 is then calculated as follows: [(29908.18/ 1975.93)-1] x 100%= 1413.62%, meaning that from the year of 2020 to the year of 2021, the revenue generated from the paid search channel increased by 1413.62%. 2.2.3 Relative Frequency For the frequency analysis, we also can count how often something happens divided by all outcomes, which is called the relative frequency analysis. For example, from Table 3, the revenue from the organic search channel in 2020 is $4,628.44, and the total revenue in 2020 is the sum of revenue from all channels, which is $34422.26.The relative revenue from the organic search channel is 4,628.44/34422.26 = 13.44%, indicating 13.44% of the revenue in 2020 was from the organic search channel. We can use the codes below to get the relative revenue for each channel in 2020 and 2021 (Table 2.4). Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2020 &lt;- my_data_2020 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(&#39;Revenue_Percentage&#39; = sum(Revenue)/sum(my_data_2020$Revenue)) Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2021 &lt;- my_data_2021 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(&#39;Revenue_Percentage&#39; = sum(Revenue)/sum(my_data_2021$Revenue)) knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2020, desc(Revenue_Percentage))), head(arrange(Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2021, desc(Revenue_Percentage)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 2.4: Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021 Channel Revenue_Percentage Direct 0.6846058 Organic Search 0.1344607 (Other) 0.0916502 Paid Search 0.0574027 Referral 0.0251211 Social 0.0047880 Channel Revenue_Percentage Direct 0.9618529 Paid Search 0.0312225 (Other) 0.0054213 Referral 0.0008895 Display 0.0003699 Organic Search 0.0001969 2.2.4 Percentage Points We can use the term “percentage points” to compare two different percentages at two points in time. The best way to explain this is through an example: from Table 2.4, in 2020, the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel was 5.74%. In 2021, the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel was 3.12%. The difference of these two percentages is calculated in percentage points: 3.12 % - 5.74 % = -2.62%. This means that the share of revenue from Paid Search channel in 2021 was almost three percentage points lower than the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel in 2020. 2.2.5 Rate In data analysis, some variables, such as the ECR (e-commerce conversion rate from Table 2.1), are too small to visualize. Under such circumstances, we can represent the percentage as rate by converting the small proportions to a whole number with one, two, or three digits on a base of some multiple of 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, or 1 million. For example, from Table 2.1, in 2020, the Ecommerce Conversion Rate of the organic search channel for users of 25 to 34 is 0.00068 or 0.068%. Instead of reporting the percentage, we can move the decimal place farther to the right, sufficient to make a number greater than 1, which allows us to better visualize the data. In the case of Ecommerce Conversion Rate, moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying the value by 10,000. Consequently, the Ecommerce Conversion Rate of the organic search channel was 6.8 per 10,000 sessions. We can use the r code below to add a column representing the Ecommerce Conversion Rate per 10,000 sessions for my_data. my_data$ECR &lt;- my_data$`Ecommerce Conversion Rate`*10000 Now, the new column has been added to my_data as illustrated in Table 2.5. knitr::kable(head(my_data[,1:13], 20), digits = 5, booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;The First 20 Rows of the Google Analytics Sample Data&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 6.5) Table 2.5: The First 20 Rows of the Google Analytics Sample Data Channel Age Users New Users Sessions Bounce Rate Pages / Session Avg.

We first use the r code below to create a new column old user (users - new users), then we use the group_by function to calculate the ratio fo returning users and new users for each channel. #creating a new colunme of old users my_data$OldUsers &lt;- my_data$Users-my_data$&#39;New Users&#39; userratio &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(OldUsers = sum(OldUsers), NewUsers = sum(`New Users`),Ratio = sum(OldUsers)/sum(`New Users`)) From Table 2.6, we can find that besides the un-defined channel, the referral channel has a relatively higher ratio of returning (old) users to new users, indicating a better retention rate. knitr::kable( head(arrange(userratio, desc(Ratio))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;The Ratio of Old Users and New Users for Each Channel&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 2.6: The Ratio of Old Users and New Users for Each Channel Channel OldUsers NewUsers Ratio (Other) 3383 7268 0.4654651 Referral 8101 23027 0.3518044 Paid Search 2116 11593 0.1825239 Affiliates 1002 8071 0.1241482 Organic Search 8428 81809 0.1030205 Display 524 7624 0.0687303 2.2.7 Central Tendency Besides using frequency analysis to summarize the distribution of a variable, we also can use the central tendency analysis to understand which attribute of a variable is most typical or representative of the variable distribution. Specifically, the central tendency analysis describes what the center of the data for a variable is. What do we mean by the center of the data? For many, the mean, median, and mode. Mean is the sum of all data points divided by the total number of observations. Median is the midpoint in data with an equal number of data points above and below. If the number of data points is even, then Median is the mean of the two midpoints. Mode is the data point that is most prevalent in the data set. It represents the most likely outcome in a data set. Let’s first create a small dataset of test scores from 20 students. StudentID &lt;- c(1:20) Score &lt;- c(40,50,50,60,60,60,60,60,70,70,70,80,80,80,80,90,90,90,90,100) TestData &lt;- data.frame(StudentID, Score) ScoreFrequency &lt;- as.data.frame(table(TestData$Score)) # Calculate the frequency of each score colnames(ScoreFrequency) &lt;- c(&quot;Score&quot;,&quot;Frequency&quot;) Table 2.7 demonstrates the frequency of each score. knitr::kable( head(arrange(ScoreFrequency)), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Frequency of Test Scores from 20 Students&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 16) Table 2.7: Frequency of Test Scores from 20 Students Score Frequency 40 1 50 2 60 5 70 3 80 4 90 4 The mean score is the sum of all scores divided by 20. The related formula is: (40x1 + 50x2 + 60x5 + 70x3 + 80x4 +90x4 + 100x1)/20 = 71.5, meaning that the average score among these 20 students is 71.5. When it comes to identifying the median value, we want to sort all individuals from the lowest value to the highest value, and whoever in the middle gives us the median value. But the problem is, we have 20 students in this sample, which is an even number, meaning that there will be two individuals in the middle (Table 2.8: student number 10 and number 11). For situations like this, we take the mean of these two individuals’ values to compute the median: (70+70)/2 = 70 (Table 2.8). knitr::kable(head(TestData, 20), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;A Small Dataset of Test Scores from 20 Students&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 16) Table 2.8: A Small Dataset of Test Scores from 20 Students StudentID Score 1 40 2 50 3 50 4 60 5 60 6 60 7 60 8 60 9 70 10 70 11 70 12 80 13 80 14 80 15 80 16 90 17 90 18 90 19 90 20 100 We can easily identify the most frequent test score by looking into the score distribution visualization. # You will need install ggplot2 package library(ggplot2) # Barplot ggplot(ScoreFrequency, aes(x=Score, y=Frequency)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Figure 2.1: Distribution of Test Scores from 20 Students Since 60 is the most frequent data point, it is the mode of the dataset. When we do the central tendency analysis, we also need to consider the data types. While interval and ratio data have a median, mode, and mean, the nominal data has only a mode. Furthermore, when the data distribution is symmetrical, such as your data is normally distributed, the mean is the best measure of central tendency. But, when the dataset has a strongly skewed distribution, the best indicator of central tendency is the median or mode, with the median usually preferred. 2.2.8 Data Variation Let’s start the data variation ### Case Study "],["text-analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Text Analysis", " Chapter 3 Text Analysis "],["network-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Network Analysis", " Chapter 4 Network Analysis "],["geo-spatial-analysis-and-visualizations.html", "Chapter 5 Geo-Spatial Analysis and Visualizations", " Chapter 5 Geo-Spatial Analysis and Visualizations "],["publishing.html", "Chapter 6 Publishing", " Chapter 6 Publishing "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
