In particular, the ability to use statistics to analyze and interpret the data obtained from tracking user interactions on websites and social media platforms make Communications students stand out in competitive job markets from a variety of industries. However, the integration of analytics into universities’ communication programs and curricula (e.g., Journalism, Television and Cinema, Public Relations, Strategic Communications, Communication Design, Health Communication, Sports Communication, Environmental Communication) is yet to catch up to the industry’s new demands. To address this need, this book introduces Communication students to R, which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, to measure and analyze audiences’ digital footprints, employ data-driven problem solving to gauge audience engagement, formulate insights, plan and execute strategies, and evaluate outcomes. 0.1 Who is this book for? Anyone who wants to learn basic data methodology and how to use the R programming language. Specifically, this book relies on analyzing text and social media and focuses on creating effective visualizations and avoiding methodological errors. R is a statistical programming language, but we’ll be using it in a way that doesn’t require that you have an extensive statistical background. 0.2 Why R? First of all, R is free, open-source, and runs on any OS. It is used by many professional journalistic and scientific organizations (The Guardian, the New York Times, etc.) for statistical analysis and data visualization. R is a package-based language, meaning it downloads only the core functions and requires users to customize it to their needs. It therefore takes up a smaller amount of disc space and is highly customizeable. A common issue with package-based languages is that the packages are all designed separately, and there are frequent compatibility issues. A solution to this problem in R, known as the tidyverse, combines a number of packages that are designed to work seamlessly with each other to deal with data manipulation, time adjustment, working with strings, importing data, and more. R is a language, and its IDE, R Studio – the software we run R ‘inside’ of – adds a number of capabilities that make working in R easier, including the capability of publishing your R analysis directly to the web, as well as PDF, EPUB and .docx formats, and integrates with GitHub for version control. R Studio is capable of also working and publishing using multiple programming languages (Python, Julia, Observable), as well as text, images and interactive visualizations, so you can easily publish and share a completed data analysis project effortlessly. In fact, this entire textbook was written and published using R and R Studio (repo available here). 0.3 What will we learn to do with R in this book? We’ll start by learning the syntax of the tidyverse, which will then be used throughout the book. Using some example data sets, the book starts with data visualization so we can immediately see results from our programming. After learning the basics of formatting and visualizing data, we’ll focus on analyzing bodies of text, from great literature to social media. We’ll learn how to perform a network analysis to discover online connections between social accounts. We’ll also learn to make maps overlaid with data and how to avoid common methodological pitfalls. 0.4 Installing the Software R and R Studio must be installed separately on your computer. Start with R, by going to https://cran.rstudio.com/ and choosing a version based on the Operating System you are using. Clicking on the Mac installation brings you to a page to choose which version to download; just download the latest one for your OS (note that there are separate versions for newer and older Macs). The downloaded file is a .pkg file, which you can double-click to install R into the default location on your Mac. On a PC, the link leads you to download the base, which is what you want when first installing R. Then download R Studio from https://posit.co/downloads/. I recommend the ‘free’ version. Once everything is installed, launching R Studio should automatically load R, and you’re ready to go. 0.5 Getting Started Launching R Studio should lead you to a screen like this one: R Studio’s first loading screen I’m getting a pop-up that is asking me to install git, which will allow R Studio to run version control. This is all above our paygrade right now, but I can tell you that this pop-up won’t go away completely until you succumb to its demands and install the git tools. The R Studio interface is divided into 4 quadrants, but only 3 are visible at first: you have to click on the little ‘mimimize/maximize’ button to open the ‘Source’ tab in the upper-right. This is where we will write all of our R code, which we will then ‘send down’ to the console below it - the idea is that by writing the code in the ‘Source’ window, we can re-run it if we need to change anything. R Studio should look like this now: R Studio with the ‘Source’ tab active I personally feel that a) no one should write computer code on a white screen with black text and b) no one should write code, especially in a language that is new to them, in a 10-point font that’s hard to read. Let’s change those things by going to ‘Tools’ &gt; ‘Global Options,’ and adjusting the ‘Appearance’ of R Studio by changing the theme and the font size: Changing the font size and visual theme in R Studio Once complete, we’ll want to get used to writing our R code in the upper-left ‘Source’ tab. Here’s an example: I’ve typed ‘4 + 12’ into the ‘Source’ tab; now I’ll click the ‘Run’ button to execute the code and see the results in the console. The very useful shortcut for ‘Run’ is ‘Command-Enter’ (Mac) or Control-Enter (PC). Try it! Running our first snippet of code in the Source window 0.6 R Studio Projects One of the most common issues new R users run into is ‘finding’ all of their materials on their computer’s hard drive: their R scripts, their data files, and anything else needed to put together a report and, potentially, publish it. The easiest way to avoid this common pitfall is to create a project for each new task you’re doing in R. Creating a project requires that you specify a project folder, and then all you have to do is put your project’s assets in there. I’d recommend you create a new project for each of the hands-on coding chapters in this book. Not only will it be easier to load your data files, it’ll also make it much easier to publish successfully. OK, we’re now ready to get introduced to the tidyverse and make our first visualizations.

Choose ‘File’ -&gt; ‘New Project…’ In the popup that follows, choose ‘New Directory,’ then ‘New Project,’ and choose (or create) a location for your project folder. You can leave all the other options as-is. Your popup should look something like this: Once you’ve created a project, choose ‘File’ -&gt; ‘New File’ -&gt; ‘R Script.’ This will open up the Source pane and create a new, blank file. Let’s save it: ‘File’ -&gt; ‘Save’ - and it will automatically save in our project’s folder. OK, let’s get coding! 1.2 Loading Packages and Data The U.S. Social Security Administration keeps records on first names at birth, going back to 1890. Data Scientist and R Superstar Hadley Wickham has created an R package that lets us load this data directly into R. Using a package is a two-step process: first, you install the package onto your computer; secondly, you load the package as a library to access its functions and data in your current work environment. Put another way, a package needs only be installed once, but has to be loaded into your R environment every time you start up R Studio. install.packages(&#39;babynames&#39;) library(babynames) Where do these packages come from, and who makes them? Why? By default, packages are hosted on an online repository referred to as CRAN; they can also be installed from GitHub. And anyone can make and share an R package, for instance if they solve a complicated workflow and want to share that insight with others to save them time and redundancy. Having R package-based means that users only need to load packages relevant to their area of study - keep in mind R is used for everything from Health Sciences to Comparative Literature. Let’s take a look at the babynames package, by asking about its structure, and taking a glimpse at it: str(babynames) ## tibble [1,924,665 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ year: num [1:1924665] 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 ... ## $ sex : chr [1:1924665] &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; ... ## $ name: chr [1:1924665] &quot;Mary&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Emma&quot; &quot;Elizabeth&quot; ... ## $ n : int [1:1924665] 7065 2604 2003 1939 1746 1578 1472 1414 1320 1288 ... ## $ prop: num [1:1924665] 0.0724 0.0267 0.0205 0.0199 0.0179 ... glimpse(babynames) ## Rows: 1,924,665 ## Columns: 5 ## $ year &lt;dbl&gt; 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 1880, 18… ## $ sex &lt;chr&gt; &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F… ## $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Minnie&quot;, &quot;Margaret&quot;, &quot;Id… ## $ n &lt;int&gt; 7065, 2604, 2003, 1939, 1746, 1578, 1472, 1414, 1320, 1288, 12… ## $ prop &lt;dbl&gt; 0.07238359, 0.02667896, 0.02052149, 0.01986579, 0.01788843, 0.… The output of glimpse is a little overwhelming at first, although it makes clear there are a lot of rows in it (Excel cannot handle 1,924,665 rows of data, but this is still not ‘Big Data’). So let’s try head and tail to see the first and last 10 rows of the dataset: head(babynames, n=10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1880 F Mary 7065 0.0724 ## 2 1880 F Anna 2604 0.0267 ## 3 1880 F Emma 2003 0.0205 ## 4 1880 F Elizabeth 1939 0.0199 ## 5 1880 F Minnie 1746 0.0179 ## 6 1880 F Margaret 1578 0.0162 ## 7 1880 F Ida 1472 0.0151 ## 8 1880 F Alice 1414 0.0145 ## 9 1880 F Bertha 1320 0.0135 ## 10 1880 F Sarah 1288 0.0132 tail(babynames, n=10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2017 M Zubeyr 5 0.00000255 ## 2 2017 M Zy 5 0.00000255 ## 3 2017 M Zyel 5 0.00000255 ## 4 2017 M Zyheem 5 0.00000255 ## 5 2017 M Zyhier 5 0.00000255 ## 6 2017 M Zykai 5 0.00000255 ## 7 2017 M Zykeem 5 0.00000255 ## 8 2017 M Zylin 5 0.00000255 ## 9 2017 M Zylis 5 0.00000255 ## 10 2017 M Zyrie 5 0.00000255 Everything we’ve done up to this point has been in Base R, that is, R without any functions added via packages. Throughout this book, we’ll be relying on a collection of inter-connected packages called the Tidyverse, which drastically simplifies performing varying calculations on data. Like all packages, we first have to install and then load it. • Please note: when you install the ‘tidyverse’ package, you’ll get a prompt inside your R Console at the bottom-left, asking you a Yes/No question. You cannot proceed until you click your cursor in the Console and type out the word ‘Yes.’ Note that the Console may be cut off or obfuscated; you may need to adjust your R Studio windows to see it better. install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) library(tidyverse) Loading the Tidyverse shows the eight packages that make it up, as well as a few warnings that we can disregard. We’ll begin on focusing on three packages that will help us work with babynames: dplyr, ggplot2 and stringr. All three are loaded once we run the library(tidyverse) command. The first, dplyr, we use to manipulate data: to filter it, rearrange it,count it, do calculations for custom columns, and pivot the data to our liking. 1.3 %&gt;% The greatest and most powerful functionality added to R via the Tidyverse, in my opinion, is the ‘pipe operator:’ %&gt;% …which allows us to chain commands to each other. It can be tricky to type; the shortcut is Shift-Command-M (on a PC, it’d be Shift-Control-M). Another useful logical operator for this dataset is the ‘includes’ operator, which looks like this: %in% . I think an example will make the best sense of how to use these operators, so let’s get started with filtering. 1.4 Filtering Data If we just type ‘babynames’ in R, we’ll see the first 10 rows of data, organized by year, and an indication that there are nearly 2 million more rows remaining. That’s way too much to visualize! Let’s start by filtering for specific names: I’ll use the names of The Beatles as a starting point. babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% &#39;Ringo&#39;) ## # A tibble: 28 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1964 M Ringo 12 0.00000592 ## 2 1965 M Ringo 18 0.0000095 ## 3 1966 M Ringo 8 0.0000044 ## 4 1972 M Ringo 6 0.00000358 ## 5 1974 M Ringo 6 0.00000368 ## 6 1975 M Ringo 8 0.00000493 ## 7 1976 M Ringo 13 0.00000796 ## 8 1977 M Ringo 10 0.00000585 ## 9 1978 M Ringo 12 0.00000702 ## 10 1979 M Ringo 9 0.00000502 ## # … with 18 more rows That ‘translates’ to ‘take the babynames dataset and filter it so only values in the name column that match ’Ringo’ are included.’ The and is the pipe operator ( %&gt;% ), and the match is the %in% operator. If we wanted to look for more than one name, we’d change the syntax to use a ‘combine’ command ( c ), with the values comma-separated. Let’s try that with babynames and the Beatles. babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&#39;Ringo&#39;, &#39;Paul&#39;, &#39;George&#39;, &#39;John&#39;)) ## # A tibble: 831 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1880 F John 46 0.000471 ## 2 1880 F George 26 0.000266 ## 3 1880 M John 9655 0.0815 ## 4 1880 M George 5126 0.0433 ## 5 1880 M Paul 301 0.00254 ## 6 1881 F George 30 0.000303 ## 7 1881 F John 26 0.000263 ## 8 1881 M John 8769 0.0810 ## 9 1881 M George 4664 0.0431 ## 10 1881 M Paul 291 0.00269 ## # … with 821 more rows Now we get a ton of results - far too many to show on the screen. 1.5 Visualizing That’s where data visualization comes in: it’s often impossible to even see your results from big data without plotting it into a visual, summarized form. Our visualization package is called ggplot2, and it’s amazingly straightforward to use, once you get used to its syntax: ggplot(data, aes(x,y)) + geometry() Huh? Well, our function (think: verb) is ‘ggplot().’ Inside that, we define our ‘aesthetics’ (aes) for the visualization, which has its own set of parentheses. Inside the aesthetics, we define the columns we want to use for the x and y axes, and finally we define the type of geomtry our visualization will use, such as a bar chart ( geom_col() ), scatterplot ( geom_point() ), or line chart ( geom_line() ), for instance. Like most things in R and the Tidyverse, it’s easier to make sense of ggplot() through examples: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% &#39;Ringo&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop)) + geom_line() To review, we take ‘babynames,’ and filter so the name includes ‘Ringo;’ We then plot by setting the aesthetics to use the ‘year’ and ‘prop’ columns of our dataset; our plot will be a line chart. Learning by example often raises as many questions as it answers, so I’ll try to address those as we go along. Let’s take this one step further: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&#39;Ringo&#39;, &#39;John&#39;, &#39;George&#39;, &#39;Paul&#39;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_point() That looks really weird! Why? In summary, becuase there is a ‘Sex’ column in the data. So, for any year - say, 1974 - there are 4 male Ringo’s, and zero female Ringo’s - ggplot is trying to plot both the 4 and 0 values on the same vertical axis. Therefore, our solution is to filter out one sex: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&#39;Ringo&#39;, &#39;John&#39;, &#39;George&#39;, &#39;Paul&#39;)) %&gt;% filter(sex %in% &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() That’s much better - but what happened to Ringo? The other names are so much more popular that his: he doesn’t show up until 1964, and the proportion of people born per year with that name is very low in comparison to, say, ‘George.’ Let’s try filtering the ‘year’ column in order to have our ggplot ‘zoom in’ on the Ringo section. babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&#39;Ringo&#39;, &#39;John&#39;, &#39;George&#39;, &#39;Paul&#39;)) %&gt;% filter(sex %in% &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 1964) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() This visualization is more limited, but somewhat more equitable - it starts around the time the Beatles became popular, but ignores the previous popularity of some of the names (John, Paul, George). Another question arises: why are we plotting ‘prop?’ what about ‘n?’ babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&#39;Ringo&#39;, &#39;John&#39;, &#39;George&#39;, &#39;Paul&#39;)) %&gt;% filter(sex %in% &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 1964) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, n, color = name)) + geom_line() The results are very similar for ‘n’ as they were for ‘prop.’ Let’s take an example name where that’s not the case: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% &quot;Mary&quot;) %&gt;% filter(sex %in% &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% filter(year &lt; &#39;1940&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop)) + geom_line() babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% &quot;Mary&quot;) %&gt;% filter(sex %in% &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% filter(year &lt; &#39;1940&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, n)) + geom_line() # you can also try &#39;Joseph&#39; and &#39;M&#39; Note that n is a simple count of names per year, whereas prop is a calculation: total number of people given that number in a given year, divided by the total number of births. So when there are fewer names in the database, the difference between n and prop is more obvious. That’d be in the early years of the babynames dataset, when biblical names like Mary and Joseph were much more common relative to all of the names. Since then, there are just more names, meaning the prop of the most common names of long ago have nearly all gone down in prop - even if their n value is increasing. # note that we have not learned how to do this yet: babynames %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(total = n_distinct(name)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, total)) + geom_line() + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Count of Unique Names&#39;) Now that we have all of this information, we can try to answer specific questions. Let’s start with some basic ones - try to answer them on your own if you can. What was the most popular name in the first year of the database, 1890? babynames %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1890&quot;) ## # A tibble: 2,695 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1890 F Mary 12078 0.0599 ## 2 1890 F Anna 5233 0.0259 ## 3 1890 F Elizabeth 3112 0.0154 ## 4 1890 F Margaret 3100 0.0154 ## 5 1890 F Emma 2980 0.0148 ## 6 1890 F Florence 2744 0.0136 ## 7 1890 F Ethel 2718 0.0135 ## 8 1890 F Minnie 2650 0.0131 ## 9 1890 F Clara 2496 0.0124 ## 10 1890 F Bertha 2388 0.0118 ## # … with 2,685 more rows But then what? Any why two ‘=’ symbols? 1.6 Syntax Let’s start with ‘=.’ In R, you can create variables, and one way to do this is with a single ‘=’ symbol: x = 10 In the case of babynames, we’re not aiming to create a variable - we just want to limit the data to only include entries in the year 1890 - so we need to use two ‘=’ symbols to differentiate from making a variable. Two ‘=’ symbols tests to see if values are equal. Also, in this textbook we will be using the arrow function to create variables, because it works in two directions: x &lt;- 10 10 -&gt; x Way more useful than ‘=.’ So, to review, we’ll use the arrow -&gt; operator in lieu of the ‘=’ symbol, but we’ll still use ‘==’ in order to filter our data based on specific conditions, like the year equals 1890. 1.7 Creating Variables Let’s take the entire babynames dataset and create a sub-set of the data that only incudes entries from the year 1890, using a variable: babynames %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1890&quot;) -&gt; babynames_1890 Note that all of our variables, or columns, are lowercase - everything is, except the babynames themselves. R will not detect your mistake if you lowercase a name or Uppercase a Column. Now we have a variable equal to a subset of our data, and we can see its contents by typing its name: babynames_1890. That makes things much easier, if that’s the only year we want to look at - but we’ll have to plot our graphs differently. 1.8 Modifying Data Let’s begin with the arrange() function, which does as it sounds - we’ll tell it to arrange in descending order of prop: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) ## # A tibble: 2,695 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1890 M John 8502 0.0710 ## 2 1890 M William 7494 0.0626 ## 3 1890 F Mary 12078 0.0599 ## 4 1890 M James 5097 0.0426 ## 5 1890 M George 4458 0.0372 ## 6 1890 M Charles 4061 0.0339 ## 7 1890 F Anna 5233 0.0259 ## 8 1890 M Frank 3078 0.0257 ## 9 1890 M Joseph 2670 0.0223 ## 10 1890 M Robert 2541 0.0212 ## # … with 2,685 more rows So, what was the answer to our question? Well, ‘John’ has the highest proportion, but Mary has the highest count. Why does Mary have a higher ‘n’ value, but a lower proportion - in the same year? Because ‘prop’ also takes sex into account, i.e. it counts the proportion of each sex in each year that receives a given name. Let’s account for this somewhat confusing aspect to our data by splitting it up along the variable that is giving us a hard time: sex. But sex is the least of our problems, as we’ll see. 1.9 Count Let’s try by using a new function, count(), which does exactly what it sounds like. We can specify to sort the results; for some archaic reason, we have to write the words ‘true’ and ‘false’ in ALL CAPS: babynames_1890 %&gt;% count(sex, sort = TRUE) ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## sex n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 F 1534 ## 2 M 1161 That’s not very many names - less than 3,000 unique names in the U.S. in 1890. It’s also notable there are more female names than male - not more women, just more variety in the names for females births. count() can be helpful, but note that it strips away all of the columns except the one we counted - and adds an ‘n’ column. But that’s it - prop, count, name, year - all gone. More on count(later). Let’s plot the most popular names of 1890 - but first, we have to cut them off, as 2,695 names is too many to plot: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1890 M John 8502 0.0710 ## 2 1890 M William 7494 0.0626 ## 3 1890 F Mary 12078 0.0599 ## 4 1890 M James 5097 0.0426 ## 5 1890 M George 4458 0.0372 ## 6 1890 M Charles 4061 0.0339 ## 7 1890 F Anna 5233 0.0259 ## 8 1890 M Frank 3078 0.0257 ## 9 1890 M Joseph 2670 0.0223 ## 10 1890 M Robert 2541 0.0212 We can plot ten names, easy: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(name, prop)) + geom_col() As a reminder, in ggplot() we define our aesthetics by specifying which columns will create the x- and y-axes. We then indicate the type of graph we want to make - in this case a column chart. Why not a line chart like before? Because line charts only work with continous variables, like year. In this case, we are only plotting the data from one year, so year is no longer something we can plot. We are plotting name and prop, which are discrete variables. What’s the difference? To oversimplify, discrete variables can be counted - how many Steve’s show up in babynames, for instance - and continuous variables are measured, like years, as well as temperature, wind speed, etc. So what is prop? Prop is a calculated variable, in that it’s the result of an equation: the total number of births of a particular gender in a specific year, divided by the total number of instances of a particular name. In other words, we’re counting things. So it’s a discrete variable. We would make a line chart [ geom_line() ] when using a continuous variable, like year, as we did with the Beatles. In this case, plotting name and prop will make the most sense in a column chart (we usually call these bar charts, but ggplot’s bar charts are a little trickier to plot than column charts, and we’re aiming for easiness right now). Looking back at our chart’s results, I would prefer the results in order or prop. Why didn’t arrange(desc(prop)) do that for us? Well, long story, but basically, regardless of how you reshape your data, ggplot() is going to need its own set of instructions for how to visualize it in a particular order. So arrange() doesn’t work - we have to make the adjustment inside the ggplot() call: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop)) + geom_col() OK, that got pretty complicated. Three nested parentheses? Let’s look at the offending line: originally, the ‘aesthetics’ of our ggplot() were: aes(name, prop) And we want to reorder the ‘names,’ based on ‘prop:’ reorder(name, prop) In other words, italics ‘I want to reorder the names based on their proportion.’ Let’s put it back together: aes(reorder(name, prop), prop)) And to see it in action: babynames_1890 %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop)) + geom_col() OK, but why is it in the wrong order? We just have to ‘tell’ ggplot() to reverse, or do the opposite of, the order it chose. We can use the minus sign for this: babynames_1890 %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, -prop), prop)) + geom_col() 1.10 More Aesthetics Let’s add some color: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, -prop), prop, color = &quot;red&quot;)) + geom_col() That didn’t work the way it did for The Beatles! Of course, that was a line graph - geom_line() - and that line has a color. This time, ‘color’ is read as stroke or outline; fill controls our columns. Also, we need to move the fill command to inside the geometry: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, -prop), prop)) + geom_col(fill = &quot;blue&quot;) Great. Now let’s make the fill based on the value of a column: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, -prop), prop, fill = name)) + geom_col() OK, great. The names are all different colors because they are discrete data points, i.e. they are not measured - like ‘prop:’ We did this by setting our fill color to a variable - in this case, name. Since ‘prop’ is measured, or discrete, it is visualized as a range of a single color. This would all look better sideways: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = prop)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() That last line, connected to the geometry with a ‘+’ symbol, tells ggplot to flip the coordinates of our plot 90 degrees. By the way, we could ‘show’ the anomaly about John and Mary having confusing ‘n’ and ‘prop’ values by adjusting our aesthetics - let’s use fill: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() We’d mentioned earlier that the ‘sex’ column is complicating our use of ‘prop’ over ‘n.’ To account for this problem, we could color by sex: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = sex)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() One more ggplot() trick to change the way we visualize our data: making multiple graphs, based on a variable: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = sex)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~sex) What facet_wrap is trying to do is create multiple graphs based on one variable - in this case, Sex. That looks…. terrible. Why? The function facet_wrap() is trying to use the same values, and the same scale, for each of the two graphs. Let’s ‘free’ the y-axis to account for this discrepancy: babynames_1890 %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = sex)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~sex, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) Wow, that really changes things - weren’t there more female than male names, when we used count() earlier? Sure, but while there may be more variance in female names in 1890, females only have two of the most common names. 1.11 Review OK, so now we can answer some other direct questions: What were the most popular names in 2017, the most recent year of the database?&lt; /li&gt; How would we answer this? I find it’s easiest to write our the process in English, then translate it to R and the Tidyverse: ‘Take babynames and filter it to only include entries from 2017. Then arrange the remaining entries in descending order of proportion.’ In the Tidyverse: babynames %&gt;% filter(year == 2017) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) ## # A tibble: 32,469 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2017 F Emma 19738 0.0105 ## 2 2017 F Olivia 18632 0.00994 ## 3 2017 M Liam 18728 0.00954 ## 4 2017 M Noah 18326 0.00933 ## 5 2017 F Ava 15902 0.00848 ## 6 2017 F Isabella 15100 0.00805 ## 7 2017 F Sophia 14831 0.00791 ## 8 2017 M William 14904 0.00759 ## 9 2017 M James 14232 0.00725 ## 10 2017 F Mia 13437 0.00717 ## # … with 32,459 more rows It looks like nearly 1% of American girls in 2017 were named ‘Emma.’ Olivia, Liam and Noah are also overwhelmingly popular. What about my name? My birth year? Just replace my values with yours: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&quot;Brian&quot;, &quot;Bryan&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(sex == &quot;M&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() babynames %&gt;% filter(year == 1975) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop),prop, fill = sex)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() I made the Top 10! (It’s all been downhill since then) Some reminders: We leave quotes off of the year, as it is numeric - only strings, or characters, get quotes. We make sure to reorder the data (based on popularity, or ‘prop’) before limiting it to the top 10 results. Otherwise, it could be organized alphabetically or something - and we’d be getting 10 names, but not the 10 most popular names. We have to reorder our name variable in the ggplot() to go in order of prop - even though we just reorganized the data this way 2 steps ago, ggplot() uses its own internal logic to organize the data. We have to plot as a bar chart, or column chart. Why? Because line charts are for continuous variables, like year - not discrete ones, like ‘name.’ If you can measure it, it’s continuous. If you can count it, it’s discrete.

Or, if you’re getting sick of babies, you can use these tidyverse functions on any dataset. Let’s try using one of R’s built-in ones, mtcars: data(mtcars) View(mtcars) The data is lots of older car performance statistics. Let’s try comparing weight to mpg: mtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() geom_point() creates a scatterplot, but we can also see hints of an overall trend, or correlation here - so let’s add that to the ggplot(): mtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Let’s try adding color based on a variable: mtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, color = cyl)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Great. On to mutate(). 2.1 Mutate While babynames has five columns, or variables, to play with, some observations require creating a calculated field of content - essentially generating a sixth column, in the case of babynames, to show something already in the data but not made clear. Babynames does not have rankings of popular names for each year. Could we create that column? Sure! When we rearrange our data in descending order of prop, we have essentially created rankings based on row number- we just need to ‘mutate’ the data frame to show it. babynames %&gt;% filter(year == 2017) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% mutate(rank = row_number()) ## # A tibble: 32,469 × 6 ## year sex name n prop rank ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2017 F Emma 19738 0.0105 1 ## 2 2017 F Olivia 18632 0.00994 2 ## 3 2017 M Liam 18728 0.00954 3 ## 4 2017 M Noah 18326 0.00933 4 ## 5 2017 F Ava 15902 0.00848 5 ## 6 2017 F Isabella 15100 0.00805 6 ## 7 2017 F Sophia 14831 0.00791 7 ## 8 2017 M William 14904 0.00759 8 ## 9 2017 M James 14232 0.00725 9 ## 10 2017 F Mia 13437 0.00717 10 ## # … with 32,459 more rows That looks good! We can now save this new, mutated dataset: babynames %&gt;% filter(year == 2017) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% mutate(rank = row_number()) -&gt; babynames_2017_ranked So mutate() creates a new column, and the values of that column are determined by some sort of calculation. Thus our code for mutate() declares the new column’s name (‘rank,’ in this case), and the calculation (‘row_number,’ in this case). Let’s try a practical use of mutate() by focusing on finding the most popular names of a particular generation. According to Wikipedia, the ‘Silent Generation’ were born between the years of 1928 and 1944: silent_gen &lt;- babynames %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 1927) %&gt;% filter(year &lt; 1945) Ok, we have sub-setted our data to only include the years of this generation. Let’s further simplify things by only looking at female names of the Silent Generation - and also add a ‘rank’ column: silent_gen %&gt;% filter(sex ==&quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(rank = row_number()) -&gt; silent_gen_f Ok, let’s see some results - what are the most popular female names of the Silent Generation? Let’s enhance the plot by adding a geom_text() object that fills in each name’s rank in its corresponding bar: silent_gen_f %&gt;% head(10) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name, prop), prop, fill = &quot;red&quot;)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + geom_text(aes(label = rank, hjust = 3)) It appears that Mary is the most popular name during this period. But wasn’t Mary popular back in 1890? Let’s look at these 10 names over time: babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(head(silent_gen_f$name, n = 10))) %&gt;% filter(sex ==&quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() It appears that Mary is the most popular name for a very long time, gradually waning as more and more unique names get added to the database every year (therefore decreasing its proportion). Unlike the other 9 names, it definitely doesn’t peak during this generation - so let’s remove it. babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(head(silent_gen_f$name, n = 10))) %&gt;% filter(!name %in% &#39;Mary&#39;) %&gt;% filter(sex ==&quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() That looks much better! What is that one name that is peaking like crazy right in the middle? babynames %&gt;% filter(name %in% &quot;Shirley&quot;) %&gt;% filter(sex ==&quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, prop, color = name)) + geom_line() Wow! What could we possibly blame this on? The popularity of Shirley Temple? There’s no way to quantitatively measure that, even if we think it to be true. 2.2 Group_by , Summarize() Similar to creating a pivot table, the summarize() command reshapes your data by creating an entirely new dataset based on the parameters you specify. It is often used with the function group_by(). How is this useful, and how is it different from mutate? An example will help. If we look at most popular names of the Silent Generation, we see a lot of names repeated: silent_gen_f %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 6 ## year sex name n prop rank ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1928 F Mary 66869 0.0559 1 ## 2 1930 F Mary 64146 0.0550 10712 ## 3 1929 F Mary 63510 0.0549 5437 ## 4 1931 F Mary 60296 0.0546 15960 ## 5 1932 F Mary 59872 0.0541 20937 ## 6 1933 F Mary 55507 0.0531 26037 ## 7 1934 F Mary 56924 0.0526 30895 ## 8 1935 F Mary 55065 0.0507 35868 ## 9 1937 F Mary 55642 0.0505 45616 ## 10 1936 F Mary 54373 0.0505 40760 If we want to count the total number of instances of each name over time, we’d have to use group_by() and summarise(), as well as n_distinct(), which counts the number of unique instances of a variable. In other words, if we want to see how many instances of each name there were per year, and plot it, we need to use summarize(): babynames %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarise(name_count = n_distinct(name)) -&gt; distinct View(distinct) ggplot(distinct, aes(year, name_count)) + geom_line() Note that, unlike mutate(), summarize() removes all of our dataframe’s columns except the ones we specify we want to look at in both summarize() and group_by(). So if we want to ‘keep’ a variable in order to later visualize it, we have to add it to the group_by() function: babynames %&gt;% group_by(year, sex) %&gt;% summarise(name_count = n_distinct(name)) -&gt; distinct ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the ## `.groups` argument. ggplot(distinct, aes(year, name_count)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~sex) Summarize() is the most challenging of the basic dplyr functions, so don’t be discouraged if you struggle with it! Again, if already familiar with the concept of a Pivot Table, summarize() is basically the same, but in programmatic form: select the columns you wish to compare, strip away the rest of the data, and give me a simplified dataframe that can be visualized. When do you know to use summarize() instead of mutate()? Well, think of mutate as making a calculated field, adding a column to your dataframe - and summarize() as making a pivot table, stripping away most of your data to look at only a handful of columns in a new way. In the case of babynames, it’s clearly an appropriate time to use summarize() when you see the same name repeated over and over again in your results. We will revisit both techniques. Playing with the babynames dataset allows us to learn basic data manipulation and visualization, while avoiding other important topics, such as loading data files into R or doing basic statistical calculations - which we will get into shortly. In the meantime, play around with babynames and try to answer specific questions, such as: What generation saw the most births in the 20th Century? How have ‘virtue names,’ like ‘Charity,’ ‘Temperance,’ or ‘Faith’ fared in babynames: are they more or less popular now than in the past? What are the total number of names per year, and is this total increasing or decreasing? 2.3 Working with Strings library(babynames) library(tidyverse) library(tidytext) library(textdata) Stringr is a package in the tidyverse that deals with, well, strings. What are strings? Anything in your data frame that is text- or character-based. So, in the case of babynames, that’d be Name and Sex - Year, Prop and N are not strings. Stringr allows for string manipulation across your entire dataset. If, for instance, we had a column of character data that repeatedly mis-spelled a name: Bryan instead of Brian, say - stringr could change every instance of Bryan into Brian in one line of code. Let’s start playing around with stringr by creating a variable that is equal to a string: library(stringr) sentence &lt;- c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;this is a long sentence&quot;, NA) Here are some functions from the stringr package that we can use to manipulate this sentence. How many characters are there in the string? str_length(sentence) ## [1] 5 23 NA Let’s replace every instance of ‘l’ with ‘x’ str_replace(sentence, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) ## [1] &quot;heXlo&quot; &quot;this is a Xong sentence&quot; ## [3] NA Okay, now let’s create a new string that is a list of character strings: list &lt;- c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;) Let’s use str_sub to ‘pull out’ the first character of the string: str_sub(list, 1,1) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; What just happened? We told R to only grab the first character. Can we grab the first three characters? str_sub(list, 1,3) ## [1] &quot;App&quot; &quot;Ban&quot; &quot;Pea&quot; Let’s adjust the string’s content so each fruit is written entirely in lower case: str_to_lower(list) ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;pear&quot; We can also use stringr to detect specific words or phrases: str_detect(list, &quot;Pear&quot;) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE R returns the position of “Pear” in the list. 2.3.1 Practical Applications of Stringr Let’s apply more Stringr concepts to a body of text. Where could we find text? How would we get text into R? One way would be a ‘web scrape’ - programmatically grabbing all the relevant text off of a page, or a series of pages - think Amazon product reviews. Another would be to import a body of text, like a .txt file, into R, and then break it up into individual words - more on this in the next chapter. A third way would be to use data included in an R package. More commonly, packages give you access to online datasets too large to download (Spotify, The New York Times, etc.). This technique, of selectively downloading relevant data from a much larger, online database, is the basis for the concept of an ‘API.’ [Application Programming Interface, if you’re wondering.] Many websites also use APIs, with downloadable files for analysis. So as to avoid any complication, let’s hold off on accessing an API until we cover Twitter, and continue to use the babynames dataset for now; then we can move on to analyzing lyrics, political speeches, and great works of literature. A snippet of Base R here, rather than the tidyverse: if we want to specify a column in our dataset, we write the name of the dataset or variable, then the dollar sign, then the name of the column: babynames$name ## [1] &quot;Mary&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Emma&quot; &quot;Elizabeth&quot; &quot;Minnie&quot; ## [6] &quot;Margaret&quot; &quot;Ida&quot; &quot;Alice&quot; &quot;Bertha&quot; &quot;Sarah&quot; ## [11] &quot;Annie&quot; &quot;Clara&quot; &quot;Ella&quot; &quot;Florence&quot; &quot;Cora&quot; ## [16] &quot;Martha&quot; &quot;Laura&quot; &quot;Nellie&quot; &quot;Grace&quot; &quot;Carrie&quot; ## [21] &quot;Maude&quot; &quot;Mabel&quot; &quot;Bessie&quot; &quot;Jennie&quot; &quot;Gertrude&quot; ## [26] &quot;Julia&quot; &quot;Hattie&quot; &quot;Edith&quot; &quot;Mattie&quot; &quot;Rose&quot; ## [31] &quot;Catherine&quot; &quot;Lillian&quot; &quot;Ada&quot; &quot;Lillie&quot; &quot;Helen&quot; ## [36] &quot;Jessie&quot; &quot;Louise&quot; &quot;Ethel&quot; &quot;Lula&quot; &quot;Myrtle&quot; ## [41] &quot;Eva&quot; &quot;Frances&quot; &quot;Lena&quot; &quot;Lucy&quot; &quot;Edna&quot; ## [46] &quot;Maggie&quot; &quot;Pearl&quot; &quot;Daisy&quot; &quot;Fannie&quot; &quot;Josephine&quot; ## [51] &quot;Dora&quot; &quot;Rosa&quot; &quot;Katherine&quot; &quot;Agnes&quot; &quot;Marie&quot; ## [56] &quot;Nora&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Mamie&quot; &quot;Blanche&quot; &quot;Stella&quot; ## [61] &quot;Ellen&quot; &quot;Nancy&quot; &quot;Effie&quot; &quot;Sallie&quot; &quot;Nettie&quot; ## [66] &quot;Della&quot; &quot;Lizzie&quot; &quot;Flora&quot; &quot;Susie&quot; &quot;Maud&quot; ## [71] &quot;Mae&quot; &quot;Etta&quot; &quot;Harriet&quot; &quot;Sadie&quot; &quot;Caroline&quot;

Let’s combine our previous experience with ggplot to write a long, complicated set of code that will visualize the most popular names starting in ‘Sh’ for women born in 1938: babynames %&gt;% filter(str_detect(name, &quot;Sh&quot;) &amp; sex==&quot;F&quot; &amp; year == 1938) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(20) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name,prop),prop, fill = name)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() Let’s fancy that up a bit, by calculating a ‘percentage’ of use of that name per year / per gender: babynames %&gt;% filter(str_detect(name, &quot;Sh&quot;) &amp; sex==&quot;F&quot; &amp; year == 1938) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) %&gt;% head(20) %&gt;% mutate(percent = (prop * 100)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(name,percent),percent, fill = name)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() how many ‘z’ names since 2000? babynames %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 2000 &amp; str_detect(name, &quot;Z&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) ## # A tibble: 13,018 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2001 M Zachary 18186 0.00880 ## 2 2002 M Zachary 16622 0.00805 ## 3 2003 M Zachary 15539 0.00740 ## 4 2004 M Zachary 13711 0.00649 ## 5 2005 M Zachary 12283 0.00578 ## 6 2006 M Zachary 11005 0.00502 ## 7 2007 M Zachary 10212 0.00461 ## 8 2008 M Zachary 9226 0.00424 ## 9 2012 F Zoey 7466 0.00386 ## 10 2009 M Zachary 8078 0.00381 ## # … with 13,008 more rows Why did R only pull out the names starting with Z?

What is the frequency of the shortest and longest names? babynames %&gt;% mutate(length = str_length(name)) -&gt; babynames_length 2.4 Average name length over time Now, if we want to see the average length of a names over time, the code gets a little mroe advanced - note the mean function we haven’t used like this before: babynames_length %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(length), funs(mean(.))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, length)) + geom_line() The results are impressive. Let’s split them up by Sex: babynames_length %&gt;% group_by(year, sex) %&gt;% summarise_at(vars(length), funs(mean(.))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(year, length, color = sex)) + geom_line() 2.5 Revisiting summarize() As mentioned in the last Chapter, summarize() is confusing. In the case of babynames, you’ll know to use it when you keep getting the same results over and over, and you want to group those names together. Let’s take a look at this issue by calculating the most common 3-letter names: babynames_length %&gt;% filter(length == 3) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) ## # A tibble: 41,274 × 6 ## year sex name n prop length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1975 F Amy 32252 0.0207 3 ## 2 1976 F Amy 31341 0.0199 3 ## 3 1974 F Amy 29564 0.0189 3 ## 4 1973 F Amy 26964 0.0174 3 ## 5 1977 F Amy 26731 0.0163 3 ## 6 1972 F Amy 25873 0.0160 3 ## 7 1880 F Ida 1472 0.0151 3 ## 8 1971 F Amy 26238 0.0150 3 ## 9 1881 F Ida 1439 0.0146 3 ## 10 1882 F Ida 1673 0.0145 3 ## # … with 41,264 more rows We get a lot of repeated names.

Thus, we cannot accurately estimate the most common 15-letter names. Along similar lines, an analysis of the methodology behind babynames shows that only names that have at least 5 instances in a given year are recorded. So it’d be similarly futile for us to attempt to measure the rarest names, as they are excluded in the database. (It also helps clarify why some rarer names seem to ‘disappear’ in certain years.) 2.6 Additional Functions OK, what else can stringr do?

Because the first is counting names, the second is counting births. And most babies have names that are shared with other babies, especially in the same year. 2.8 Assignment Create a report using the Hadley Wickham packaged dataset ‘babynames.’ Requirements: The report should include at least four observations, with visualizations. At least two of them should be unique, i.e., not something we already did in class. For example, if you did the ‘Beatles’ example I mentioned in class, you can plot those names over time. But what else? What about the period that the Beatles became popular? Could you annotate your visualizations to show that period? What about names like ‘John’ over time – can you really make an argument that one man had an outsized influence on this already popular name? Did other bands have a similar influence, or just the Beatles? Did the popularity of the Beatles names sustain itself, or die out over time? Perhaps a better, more quantitative approach is to avoid celebrity, and focus only on the dataset. What are the most common first or last letters in names over time? What about name length? Etc. Your report must propose a hypothesis, or introduce a topic for exploration, explain your process (code) and results (visualizations), and then have a conclusion that argues that your hypothesis was either proven or disproven, and why you think that is. Even if your topic is silly, your report should adhere to this presentation method, and your tone should be more academic than friendly. Text content can be written as comments, with the ‘#’ in the front of the line. Code can be left just as code; feel free to use comments to clarify what you’re doing. Your report can be evaluated based on the following items: Focus on your methodology: are your results reproducible? Did you filter or limit the data in a logical, non-arbitrary way? Choose a hypothesis that has nothing to do with you. Our aim is to generate reproducible results; no one will want to replicate the results of your name. Your hypothesis should be something that makes sense to anyone: names starting with vowels are increasing in proportion, biblical names are on the decline, ‘Game of Thrones’ is causing Americans to give their children unfathomably terrible first names. For each visualization, consider including a paragraph describing your findings, and another paragraph describing your process. If you use an external source, be sure to include the URL in a comment.

Any quality that can vary can be considered a variable. Variables can take on different values or attributes. An attribute is a specific value on a variable. For example, gender might be a variable that we are interested in, and the attributes of gender could be male, female, transgender, and non-binary. We use levels of measurement to describe how precisely variables are recorded. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio representing the transition from analyzing qualitative to quantitative data. 3.1.1 Nominal Data Nominal data is used to label variables. Gender, nationality, race, and ethnicity are a few of the most common examples of nominal data. It can only be categorized based on qualitative differences and there are no orderings or directions among different categories. We only know that males and females have qualitative differences in terms of gender, but we cannot tell how much they differ, nor could we sort individuals based on their gender. We can still assign numbers to different attributes of nominal variables (e.g., we can assign 1 to females and 2 to males, or vice versa), but the numbers only serve as labels that lack numerical values. For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 1), the variable Channel is measured at the nominal level, and it indicates the channel through which traffic got to Google Merchandise Store. Organic Search indicates visits from unpaid search results. Direct indicates visits where users navigated directly to the URL, or the source of the visit is unknown. Referral indicates traffic where users clicked a link from another site, excluding major search engines. Display indicates traffic from display advertising, such as Google AdWords remarketing campaigns. Social indicates visits from social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Paid Search indicates traffic from the PPC (Pay Per Click) campaigns run in search results. Since each variable should be exhaustive to include all the possibilities, for the variable of Channel, the attribute “Other” is assigned referring to traffic from an un-identified channel. All these different channels through which a user reaches our website are different attributes our channel variable can have. 3.1.2 Ordinal Data Ordinal data also can be categorized, but there are rankings or orderings or scaling between categories. The ordinal measurement has been widely used to analyze variables such as education level (e.g., “high school,” “BS,” “MS,” “Ph.D.”), income level (e.g., “less than 50K,” “50-100K,” “over 100K”), and socioeconomic status (e.g., “lower class,” “middle class,” and “upper class”). For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 2.1), the variable Age is also ordinal, and it refers to the age group of the users. For such ordinal variable, we can turn it into quantitative by assigning numerical values to different categories. For example, Age can be defined as having six attributes:1 = 18-24; 2 = 25-34; 3 = 35-44; 4 = 45-54; 5 = 55-64; 6 = 65+. There is a logical ordering among the different age groups, in a way that whoever answers “6” is older than individuals who answer “5” to this question. However, we cannot precisely tell the differences between the two groups because each attribute covers a wide range, and the ranges of different attributes are of different sizes. 3.1.3 Interval Data Interval data refers not only to the classification and ordering of data but also specifies that the distances between every two adjacent attributes on a scale are equal. For interval data, the difference between two values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point or fixed beginning, which refers to a scale where 0 indicates the absence of something. The most popular example is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. The difference between 90 degrees F and 80 degrees F is the same difference between 70 degrees F and 60 degrees F; however, when it comes to 0 degrees F, we cannot say that temperature no longer exists. For interval measures, the value 0 does not mean the absence of this variable; rather, it is just an arbitrary setting that we have agreed upon. Another example of interval data is year. For year, 0 does not represent the missing value but indicates the year when Christ was born, and the time before 0 is given the prefix BC. If you were born in the year of 2005 and I was born in the year of 2000, we know that I will be five years older than you. For the dataset of Google Analytics from Google Merchandise Store (Table 2.1), the only interval variable is Year, indicating the year of each observation. 3.1.4 Ratio Data For ratio data, the difference between two values is also meaningful, and it has a true zero, indicating the absence of such variable. Media consumption is a great example of ratio data. Media consumption can be measured in days, hours, or minutes a person exposes him/herself to media content. If a person has zero media consumption, that means this person does not consume media at all; in other words, to this person, media consumption is absent. For ratio data, zero is the starting point, and the distance between two adjacent values is the same. In addition, it makes sense to calculate the ratio of different values: If you have six hours of media consumption and I only have three hours, then we can say that you consume twice as much media as I do. Table 2.1 has six ratio variables. Sessions are the total number of sessions within the date range. A session is the period time a user is actively engaged with the website of Google Merchandise Store. Users are the number of users who have initiated at least one session during the date range, with the value of zero representing no such user exists. New Users are the number of first-time users during the selected date range. Transactions are the number of completed purchases on Google Merchandise Store. Ecommerce Conversion Rate refers to the E-commerce conversion rate that is the percentage of sessions that resulted in an e-commerce transaction. Revenue refers to the revenue of the completed purchases. If the revenue from the display channel is 0, that just means there is no income produced by the display Ads. What you can do to analyze your data may be limited due to the level of measurement of the variable. The complexity and precision of the level of measurement increase from nominal to ratio. For the ratio level of measurement, we can not only add numbers or subtract numbers but calculate the ratio of two numbers. For example, if the revenue from the organic search channel is 8k and from the paid search is 4k, then the revenue generated from organic search is twice as much as the revenue from paid search. The rows in a spreadsheet are closely associated with the unit of analysis, which is one of the most important ideas in a research project and the major entity that you are analyzing in your study. You will need to determine the unit of analysis since it determines the analysis you do for your research. For instance, if you are comparing the e-commerce performances (e.g., User, Sessions, Transactions, Revenues, ECR) of different channels, the unit of analysis is each individual channel. If you are comparing the e-commerce performance of different age groups, the unit of analysis is each age group. If you are comparing the e-commerce performance of different channels and age groups, the unit of analysis is each individual channel at each age group. After defining your research questions and the related unit(s) of analysis, and levels of measurement, we may start the data analysis journey by conducting a statistical analysis of a single variable. 3.2 Frequency Distribution The easiest thing we can do is to count the number of times an event or a value occurs for the variable(s) of our choice, and this is called Frequency analysis. We can aggregate individual observations of a variable into groups so that a frequency distribution of these groups can serve as a convenient means of summarizing or describing our data. We are going to use the tidyverse package to count the aggregated transactions by channel and age groups. #Frequency and grouped frequency analysis #You will need to install dplyr package library(tidyverse) Transaction_Frequency_Channel &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Frequency = sum(Transactions)) Transaction_Frequency_Age &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Age) %&gt;% summarise(Frequency = sum(Transactions)) Table 3.2 demonstrated the grouped frequency of transactions for each channel and age group. From the frequency analysis, we can tell that the direct channel (n = 11581) and the age group of 25 to 34 (n = 4654) had the greatest number of transactions in Google Merchandise Store. knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Transaction_Frequency_Channel, desc(Frequency))), head(arrange(Transaction_Frequency_Age, desc(Frequency)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Transaction Frequency for Channel and Age&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.2: Grouped Transaction Frequency for Channel and Age Channel Frequency Direct 11581 Paid Search 330 (Other) 138 Organic Search 98 Referral 32 Display 6 Age Frequency 25-34 4654 18-24 2558 35-44 2496 45-54 1394 55-64 673 65+ 414 3.3 Percentage Change Here, we can also use the grouped frequency analysis to compare the revenue from each channel between 2020 and 2021 to assess the dynamic changes of each channel. #Creat a subset for year 2020 and year 2021 my_data_2020 &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(Year == 2020) my_data_2021 &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(Year == 2021) Revenue_Frequency_2020 &lt;- my_data_2020 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Revenue = sum(Revenue)) Revenue_Frequency_2021 &lt;- my_data_2021 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(Revenue = sum(Revenue)) As illustrated in Table 3.3, the direct channel created the most revenues in both 2020 and 2021. When you have such data for two points in time, you can calculate how much change there has been over this period. The result is expressed as a percentage in absolute numbers and is called the percentage change or the rate of change. Here is the formula: Percentage Change = [(Number at later time / Number at earlier time) - 1] × 100%. knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Revenue_Frequency_2020, desc(Revenue))), head(arrange(Revenue_Frequency_2021, desc(Revenue)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.3: Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021 Channel Revenue Direct 23565.6812 Organic Search 4628.4410 (Other) 3154.8063 Paid Search 1975.9309 Referral 864.7263 Social 164.8144 Channel Revenue Direct 921363.0041 Paid Search 29908.1791 (Other) 5193.1180 Referral 852.0686 Display 354.3391 Organic Search 188.6451 For example, from Table 3.3, in 2020, the revenue generated from the paid search channel was $1975.93. And in 2020, the revenue generated from the paid search channel was 29908.18. The percentage change of revenue from the paid search channel from 2020 to 2021 is then calculated as follows: [(29908.18/ 1975.93)-1] x 100%= 1413.62%, meaning that from the year of 2020 to the year of 2021, the revenue generated from the paid search channel increased by 1413.62%. 3.4 Relative Frequency For the frequency analysis, we also can count how often something happens divided by all outcomes, which is called the relative frequency analysis. For example, from Table 3.3, the revenue from the organic search channel in 2020 is $4,628.44, and the total revenue in 2020 is the sum of revenue from all channels, which is $34422.26.The relative revenue from the organic search channel is 4,628.44/34422.26 = 13.44%, indicating 13.44% of the revenue in 2020 was from the organic search channel. We can use the codes below to get the relative revenue for each channel in 2020 and 2021 (Table 3.4). Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2020 &lt;- my_data_2020 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(&#39;Revenue_Percentage&#39; = sum(Revenue)/sum(my_data_2020$Revenue)) Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2021 &lt;- my_data_2021 %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(&#39;Revenue_Percentage&#39; = sum(Revenue)/sum(my_data_2021$Revenue)) knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2020, desc(Revenue_Percentage))), head(arrange(Revenue_Relative_Frequency_2021, desc(Revenue_Percentage)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.4: Grouped Revenue in 2020 and 2021 Channel Revenue_Percentage Direct 0.6846058 Organic Search 0.1344607 (Other) 0.0916502 Paid Search 0.0574027 Referral 0.0251211 Social 0.0047880 Channel Revenue_Percentage Direct 0.9618529 Paid Search 0.0312225 (Other) 0.0054213 Referral 0.0008895 Display 0.0003699 Organic Search 0.0001969 3.5 Percentage Points We can use the term “percentage points” to compare two different percentages at two points in time. The best way to explain this is through an example: from Table 3.4, in 2020, the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel was 5.74%. In 2021, the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel was 3.12%. The difference of these two percentages is calculated in percentage points: 3.12 % - 5.74 % = -2.62%. This means that the share of revenue from Paid Search channel in 2021 was almost three percentage points lower than the share of revenue from the Paid Search channel in 2020. 3.6 Rate In data analysis, some variables, such as the ECR (e-commerce conversion rate from Table 2.1), are too small to visualize. Under such circumstances, we can represent the percentage as rate by converting the small proportions to a whole number with one, two, or three digits on a base of some multiple of 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, or 1 million. For example, from Table 3.1, in 2020, the Ecommerce Conversion Rate of the organic search channel for users of 25 to 34 is 0.00068 or 0.068%. Instead of reporting the percentage, we can move the decimal place farther to the right, sufficient to make a number greater than 1, which allows us to better visualize the data. In the case of Ecommerce Conversion Rate, moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying the value by 10,000. Consequently, the Ecommerce Conversion Rate of the organic search channel was 6.8 per 10,000 sessions. We can use the r code below to add a column representing the Ecommerce Conversion Rate per 10,000 sessions for my_data. my_data$ECR &lt;- my_data$`Ecommerce Conversion Rate`*10000 Now, the new column has been added to my_data as illustrated in Table 3.5. knitr::kable(head(my_data[,1:13], 20), digits = 5, booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;The First 20 Rows of the Google Analytics Sample Data&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 6.5) Table 3.5: The First 20 Rows of the Google Analytics Sample Data Channel Age Users New Users Sessions Bounce Rate Pages / Session Avg.

We first use the r code below to create a new column old user (users - new users), then we use the group_by function to calculate the ratio fo returning users and new users for each channel. #creating a new colunme of old users my_data$OldUsers &lt;- my_data$Users-my_data$&#39;New Users&#39; userratio &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% summarise(OldUsers = sum(OldUsers), NewUsers = sum(`New Users`),Ratio = sum(OldUsers)/sum(`New Users`)) From Table 3.6, we can find that besides the un-defined channel, the referral channel has a relatively higher ratio of returning (old) users to new users, indicating a better retention rate. knitr::kable( head(arrange(userratio, desc(Ratio))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;The Ratio of Old Users and New Users for Each Channel&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.6: The Ratio of Old Users and New Users for Each Channel Channel OldUsers NewUsers Ratio (Other) 3383 7268 0.4654651 Referral 8101 23027 0.3518044 Paid Search 2116 11593 0.1825239 Affiliates 1002 8071 0.1241482 Organic Search 8428 81809 0.1030205 Display 524 7624 0.0687303 3.8 Central Tendency Besides using frequency analysis to summarize the distribution of a variable, we also can use the central tendency analysis to understand which attribute of a variable is most typical or representative of the variable distribution. Specifically, the central tendency analysis describes what the center of the data for a variable is. What do we mean by the center of the data? For many, the mean, median, and mode. Mean is the sum of all data points divided by the total number of observations. Median is the midpoint in data with an equal number of data points above and below. If the number of data points is even, then Median is the mean of the two midpoints. Mode is the data point that is most prevalent in the data set. It represents the most likely outcome in a data set. Let’s first create a small dataset of test scores from 20 students. StudentID &lt;- c(1:20) Score &lt;- c(40,50,50,60,60,60,60,60,70,70,70,80,80,80,80,90,90,90,90,100) TestData &lt;- data.frame(StudentID, Score) ScoreFrequency &lt;- as.data.frame(table(TestData$Score)) # Calculate the frequency of each score colnames(ScoreFrequency) &lt;- c(&quot;Score&quot;,&quot;Frequency&quot;) Table 3.7 demonstrates the frequency of each score. knitr::kable( head(arrange(ScoreFrequency)), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Frequency of Test Scores from 20 Students&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 16) Table 3.7: Frequency of Test Scores from 20 Students Score Frequency 40 1 50 2 60 5 70 3 80 4 90 4 The mean score is the sum of all scores divided by 20. The related formula is: (40x1 + 50x2 + 60x5 + 70x3 + 80x4 +90x4 + 100x1)/20 = 71.5, meaning that the average score among these 20 students is 71.5. When it comes to identifying the median value, we want to sort all individuals from the lowest value to the highest value, and whoever in the middle gives us the median value. But the problem is, we have 20 students in this sample, which is an even number, meaning that there will be two individuals in the middle (Table 3.8: student number 10 and number 11). For situations like this, we take the mean of these two individuals’ values to compute the median: (70+70)/2 = 70 (Table 2.8). knitr::kable(head(TestData, 20), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;A Small Dataset of Test Scores from 20 Students&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 16) Table 3.8: A Small Dataset of Test Scores from 20 Students StudentID Score 1 40 2 50 3 50 4 60 5 60 6 60 7 60 8 60 9 70 10 70 11 70 12 80 13 80 14 80 15 80 16 90 17 90 18 90 19 90 20 100 We can easily identify the most frequent test score by looking into the score distribution visualization. # You will need install ggplot2 package library(ggplot2) # Barplot ggplot(ScoreFrequency, aes(x=Score, y=Frequency)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) Figure 3.1: Distribution of Test Scores from 20 Students Since 60 is the most frequent data point, it is the mode of the dataset. When we do the central tendency analysis, we also need to consider the data types. While interval and ratio data have a median, mode, and mean, the nominal data has only a mode. Furthermore, when the data distribution is symmetrical, such as your data is normally distributed, the mean is the best measure of central tendency. But, when the dataset has a strongly skewed distribution, the best indicator of central tendency is the median or mode, with the median usually preferred. Now we can use the code below to get the mean, median, and mode for the number of Users and New Users, number of Sessions, E-commerce Conversion Rates, Transactions, and Revenues for the Google analytics data of the Google Merchandise Store. #Calculate mean for each col mean_report &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, mean) #Calculate median for each col median_report &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, median) #Create the mode function getmode &lt;- function(v) { uniqv &lt;- unique(v) uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))] } #Calculate mode for each col mode_report &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, getmode) #combine the reports centerreport &lt;- as.data.frame(rbind(mean_report, median_report, mode_report)) rownames(centerreport) &lt;- c(&quot;Mean&quot;,&quot;Median&quot;,&quot;Mode&quot;) centerreport &lt;- centerreport[, -10] knitr::kable( head(arrange(centerreport)), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Descriptive Statistics-mean,median,mode&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.9: Descriptive Statistics-mean,median,mode Users New Users Sessions Bounce Rate Pages / Session Avg.

This also indicates reporting results of different central tendency analyses can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data distribution. For example, the mean value of Users (5661) is much higher than the median (940) and mode (22), indicating a skewed data distribution due to the existence of some large-value outliers. Weighted Mean is a special mean where some data points contribute more than others. To calculate the weighted mean, we need to consider the weight for each data point. For example, we can calculate the weighted mean of the E-commerce Conversion Rate by taking the number of users as weight. The more users each data point has, the larger weight for its E-commerce Conversion Rate (ECR). In R, we can use the function of weighted.mean as below to get the weighted mean of the ECR of the Google Store: #Calculated the weighted mean for ECR weighted.mean(my_data$`Ecommerce Conversion Rate`, my_data$Users) ## [1] 0.01783514 When taking the number of users into consideration, the weighted mean of the E-commerce Conversation Rate is almost 18 per 10,000 sessions, which is a bit higher than the normal mean, 11 per 10,000 sessions (Table above). This also indicates that the data points with high E-commerce Conversion Rates had more users than those with low rates. 3.9 Data Variation If two data sets have the same center points, does that mean they have the same data distribution? Let’s look at two small datasets: Score1 &lt;- data.frame(c(110, 90,70,50,30)) Score2 &lt;- data.frame(c(75, 70,70,70,65)) colnames(Score1) &lt;- c(&quot;Score1&quot;) colnames(Score2) &lt;- c(&quot;Score2&quot;) knitr::kable( list( head(arrange(Score1, desc(Score1))), head(arrange(Score2, desc(Score2)))), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Two Small Data Sets with the Same Mean and Median&#39; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.10: Two Small Data Sets with the Same Mean and Median Score1 110 90 70 50 30 Score2 75 70 70 70 65 Although they have the same mean (70) and median (70), the detailed data distributions vary significantly in a way that indicates the data in data set 1 were more spread out. This indicates that the mere central tendency measures cannot 100% accurately represent distribution. While the central tendency is the key to data description and prediction, variation is used to evaluate the quality of central tendency measures, and it plays an essential role in explaining statistical contribution. Variation Ratio reflects the proportion of cases that are not in the mode category. For example, from Table 3.9, the mode for Session is 3787. But this mode contains only two cases. Since the number of observations is 96, The variation ratio for Session is: (96-2)/96 = .98 or 98%, indicating the mode of 3787 is not a very representative indicator of sessions. To the contrary, for the variable of Transaction, the mode was 0 with 53 data points taking this value. The variation ratio of transaction is: (96-53)/96 = .45 or 45%, indicating “0” demonstrated relatively strong representativeness of transaction. This variation ratio also reflects the need for improvements of conversions for a variety of channels for the Google Merchandise Store. Range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores of a distribution. In our dataset, the range in class sizes is 237-17=220. Inter-ranges drops off a specified highest and lowest percentage of data points and then calculates the range of the remaining data points. The most popular inter-ranges are inter-decile range, inter-quintile range, and inter-quartile range, which drop off the highest and the lowest 10%, 20%, and 25% of the data points, respectively, and reflect the range of the remaining data points. Table 3.11 lists the range and Inter-quartile range (IQR) for the number of users and new users, number of sessions, e-commerce conversion rate, transaction, and revenue for the Google analytics dataset. #Calculate range for each col range_report &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, range) #Calculate Inter quartile range (IQR) for each col range_report_interquartile &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, IQR) #aggreate center report with range and IQR report stats_report &lt;- bind_rows(centerreport,range_report, range_report_interquartile) rownames(stats_report) &lt;- c(&quot;mean&quot;,&quot;median&quot;,&quot;mode&quot;,&quot;min&quot;,&quot;max&quot;,&quot;IQR&quot;) knitr::kable( head(arrange(stats_report)), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Descriptive Statistics&#39;, align = &quot;l&quot; ) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 14) Table 3.11: Descriptive Statistics Users New Users Sessions Bounce Rate Pages / Session Avg.

We use the quartile to divide observations into four intervals with an equal number of data points: the first quartile includes the lowest 25% of data points; the second quartile covers data points between 25.1% and 50%, which corresponds to the median; the third quartile includes data points above the median between 50.1% and 75%; the fourth quartile has the highest 25% of numbers. All data points that are above q0.75+1.5×IQR or below q0.25-1.5×IQR are considered as potential outliers. Here, q0.25 and q0.75 refers to the first and third quartile, respectively. For data from digital and social media, outliers represent important opportunities for improving audience conversion and engagement.Let take a look at how to find outlier using code. # Histogram: a simple way to detect outliers is to draw a histogram of the data. #using ggplot2(https://www.colorbook.io/hexcolors/view/0C4C8A) ggplot(my_data) + aes(x = Transactions) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000, fill = &quot;#8A1537&quot;) + theme_minimal() #TRY MORE THEME:https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html #Boxplot: in addition to histograms, boxplots are also useful to detect potential outliers. boxplot(my_data$Transactions, ylab = &quot;Transactions&quot;) #Define Outlier find_outlier &lt;- function(x) { return(x &lt; quantile(x, .25) - 1.5*IQR(x) | x &gt; quantile(x, .75) + 1.5*IQR(x)) } #add new column to data frame that indicates if each observation is an outlier my_data &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(!Channel %in% c(&#39;Direct&#39;, &#39;(Other)&#39;)) %&gt;% group_by(Age) %&gt;% mutate(outlier = ifelse(find_outlier(Transactions), Transactions, NA)) #create box plot of points by age and label outliers ggplot(my_data, aes(x=Age, y=Transactions)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_text(aes(label=outlier), na.rm=TRUE, hjust=-.5) #Try to use a different group - Channel my_data &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(!Channel %in% c(&#39;Direct&#39;, &#39;(Other)&#39;)) %&gt;% group_by(Channel) %&gt;% mutate(outlier = ifelse(find_outlier(Transactions), Transactions, NA)) #create box plot of points by Channel and label outliers ggplot(my_data, aes(x=Channel, y=Transactions)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_text(aes(label=outlier), na.rm=TRUE, hjust=-.5) For the above figures, data points related to the channels of “direct” and “other” were removed from the dataset since they might be classified due to the failure of channel detection in Google Analytics. For the paid search channel and referral channel, the audience in the age group of 25 to 34 had much more transactions compared to other age groups. This indicates the importance of using paid search and referral activities to drive more audiences in the age group of 25 to 34 to visit and shop at the store. Standard Deviation Another term for analyzing data variance is Standard Deviation. It is a measure of the amount of variation in data, or simply put, it measures the extent to which your data is spread-out. It reflects the average squared distance from the mean. Suppose we have two variables: the first one contains five units whose values are 2, 3, 3, 3, 4; and the second one contains five units as well, with the values being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Although these two variables have the same mean value (Mean = 3), you can clearly see that the latter one is more spread-out than the first one, indicating a bigger standard deviation. Below illustrates the calculations of standard deviation for the Google analytics’ transactions data. Calculations of Standard Deviation The mean of transactions is 7. We first calculated the distance of each observation’s transactions from the mean, then took the squared distance because some of the distances are positive values and others are negative. Without taking the square of these distances first, if we added all distances together, they might cancel each other out, failing to indicate the real variation of the data set. Once we get the sum of all the squared distances, we divide the sum by the number of observations (n= 96) minus 1, and then take the square root of this value to bring the distance back to the original standard scale, which gives us the standard deviation. Usually, a low standard deviation indicates that most of the data points are close to the average, while a high standard deviation means that the data points are spread out. Table 8 lists the range and standard deviation of the number of Users and New Users, number of Sessions, E-commerce Conversion Rates, Transactions, and Revenues for the Google analytics data. It is interesting to find that the standard deviations of all six variables are almost twice as large as the means, indicating high variations between values and abnormal distributions for data. 3.10 Assignment "],["statistical-analyses-of-two-variables.html", "Chapter 4 Statistical Analyses of Two Variables", " Chapter 4 Statistical Analyses of Two Variables "],["statistical-analyses-of-three-or-more-variables-modelling.html", "Chapter 5 Statistical Analyses of Three or More Variables &amp; Modelling", " Chapter 5 Statistical Analyses of Three or More Variables &amp; Modelling "],["text-analysis.html", "Chapter 6 Text Analysis 6.1 An Introduction to Stringr", " Chapter 6 Text Analysis 6.1 An Introduction to Stringr library(babynames) library(tidyverse) library(tidytext) library(textdata) Stringr is a package in the tidyverse that deals with, well, strings. What are strings? Anything in your data frame that is text- or character-based. So, in the case of babynames, that’d be Name and Sex - Year, Prop and N are not strings. Stringr allows for string manipulation across your entire dataset. If, for instance, we had a column of character data that repeatedly mis-spelled a name: Bryan instead of Brian, say - stringr could change every instance of Bryan into Brian in one line of code. Let’s start playing around with stringr by creating a variable that is equal to a string: library(stringr) sentence &lt;- c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;this is a long sentence&quot;, NA) Here are some functions from the stringr package that we can use to manipulate this sentence. How many characters are there in the string? str_length(sentence) ## [1] 5 23 NA Let’s replace every instance of ‘l’ with ‘x’ str_replace(sentence, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) ## [1] &quot;heXlo&quot; &quot;this is a Xong sentence&quot; ## [3] NA Okay, now let’s create a new string that is a list of character strings: list &lt;- c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;) Let’s use str_sub to ‘pull out’ the first character of the string: str_sub(list, 1,1) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;P&quot; What just happened? We told R to only grab the first character. Can we grab the first three characters? str_sub(list, 1,3) ## [1] &quot;App&quot; &quot;Ban&quot; &quot;Pea&quot; Let’s adjust the string’s content so each fruit is written entirely in lower case: str_to_lower(str_sub(list)) ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;pear&quot; We can also use stringr to detect specific words or phrases: str_detect(list, &quot;Pear&quot;) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE R returns the position of “Pear” in the list. 6.1.1 Practical Applications of Stringr Let’s apply more Stringr concepts to a body of text. Where could we find text? How would we get text into R? One way would be a ‘web scrape’ - programmatically grabbing all the relevant text off of a page, or a series of pages - think Amazon product reviews. Another would be to import a body of text, like a .txt file, into R, and then break it up into individual words - more on this in the next chapter. A third way would be to use data included in an R package. More commonly, packages give you access to online datasets too large to download (Spotify, The New York Times, etc.). This technique, of selectively downloading relevant data from a much larger, online database, is the basis for the concept of an ‘API.’ [Application Programming Interface, if you’re wondering.] Many websites also use APIs, with downloadable files for analysis. So as to avoid any complication, let’s hold off on accessing an API until we cover Twitter, and continue to use the babynames dataset for now; then we can move on to analyzing lyrics, political speeches, and great works of literature. A snippet of Base R here, rather than the tidyverse: if we want to specify a column in our dataset, we write the name of the dataset or variable, then the dollar sign, then the name of the column: babynames$name ## [1] &quot;Mary&quot;

In the case of babynames, you’ll know to use it when you keep getting the same results over and over, and you want to group those names together. Let’s take a look at this issue by calculating the most common 3-letter names: babynames_length %&gt;% filter(length == 3) %&gt;% arrange(desc(prop)) ## # A tibble: 41,274 × 6 ## year sex name n prop length ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1975 F Amy 32252 0.0207 3 ## 2 1976 F Amy 31341 0.0199 3 ## 3 1974 F Amy 29564 0.0189 3 ## 4 1973 F Amy 26964 0.0174 3 ## 5 1977 F Amy 26731 0.0163 3 ## 6 1972 F Amy 25873 0.0160 3 ## 7 1880 F Ida 1472 0.0151 3 ## 8 1971 F Amy 26238 0.0150 3 ## 9 1881 F Ida 1439 0.0146 3 ## 10 1882 F Ida 1673 0.0145 3 ## # … with 41,264 more rows We get a lot of repeated names.

Thus, we cannot accurately estimate the most common 15-letter names. Along similar lines, an analysis of the methodology behind babynames shows that only names that have at least 5 instances in a given year are recorded. So it’d be similarly futile for us to attempt to measure the rarest names, as they are excluded in the database. (It also helps clarify why some rarer names seem to ‘disappear’ in certain years.)
