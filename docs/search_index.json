In particular, the ability to use statistics to analyze and interpret the data obtained from tracking user interactions on websites and social media platforms make Communications students stand out in competitive job markets from a variety of industries. However, the integration of analytics into universities’ communication programs and curricula (e.g., Journalism, Television and Cinema, Public Relations, Strategic Communications, Communication Design, Health Communication, Sports Communication, Environmental Communication) is yet to catch up to the industry’s new demands. To address this need, this book introduces Communication students to R, which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, to measure and analyze audiences’ digital footprints, employ data-driven problem solving to gauge audience engagement, formulate insights, plan and execute strategies, and evaluate outcomes.
